                            <p>Passionate since I was a teenager, my first big game is FF VII.
                                Very quickly I started playing games in Japanese (without speaking or reading it) and then on the PC with games like Fallout or Little Big Adventue.
                                But my favorite "time food" was undoubtedly Diablo I, II, III. Today I only play POE, well it was before the Wild.</p>
